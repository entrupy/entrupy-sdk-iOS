2. Your Responsibilities.
  (a) General. You are responsible and liable for all uses of the Software resulting from access provided by Entrupy, directly or indirectly, whether such access or use is permitted
      by or in violation of this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you are responsible for all acts and omissions of your users, and any act or omission by a user that would constitute a breach of this Agreement if taken by you will be deemed a breach of this Agreement by you.

3. Support. This Agreement does not entitle you to any support for the Software.

4. Confidentiality & Non-disparagement.
(a) Confidential Information. From time to time during the Term, either Party may disclose or make available to the other Party information about its business affairs, products, confidential intellectual property, trade secrets, third-party confidential information, and other sensitive or proprietary information, whether orally or in written, electronic, or other form or media/in written or electronic form or media, and whether or not marked, designated or otherwise identified as "confidential" (collectively, "Confidential Information"). Confidential Information does not include information that, at the time of disclosure is: (a) in the public domain; (b) known to the receiving Party at the time of disclosure; (c) rightfully obtained by the receiving Party on a non-confidential basis from a third party; or (d) independently developed by the receiving Party. The receiving Party shall not disclose the disclosing Party's Confidential Information to any person or entity, except to the receiving Party's employees who have a need to know the Confidential Information for the receiving Party to exercise its rights or perform its obligations hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Party may disclose Confidential Information to the limited extent required (i) in order to comply with the order of a court or other governmental body, or as otherwise necessary to comply with applicable law, provided that the Party making the disclosure pursuant to the order shall first have given written notice to the other Party and made a reasonable effort to obtain a protective order; or (ii) to establish a Party's rights under this Agreement, including to make required court filings. On the expiration or termination of the Agreement, the receiving Party shall promptly return to the disclosing Party all copies, whether in written, electronic, or other form or media, of the disclosing Party's Confidential Information, or destroy all such copies and certify in writing to the
    disclosing Party that such Confidential Information has been destroyed. Each Party's obligations of non-disclosure with regard to Confidential Information are effective as of the Effective Date and will expire five years from the date first disclosed to the receiving Party; provided, however, with respect to any Confidential Information that constitutes a trade secret (as determined under applicable law), such obligations of non-disclosure will survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement for as long as such Confidential Information remains subject to trade secret protection under applicable law.
(b) Non-disparagement. You agree and covenant that you will not at any time make, publish, or communicate to any person or entity or in any public forum any defamatory or disparaging remarks, comments, or statements concerning Entrupy, or its businesses, or any of its employees, officers, and existing and prospective clients, suppliers, investors, and other associated third parties.

10. Miscellaneous.
  (a) Entire Agreement. This Agreement, together with any other documents incorporated herein by reference, constitutes the sole and entire agreement of the Parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous understandings, agreements, and representations and warranties, both written and oral, with respect to such subject matter.
  (b) Force Majeure. Entrupy will not be liable for a failure to fulfill its obligations due to causes beyond its reasonable control, including acts of God, earthquake, fire, flood, embargo, catastrophe, sabotage, utility or transmission failures, governmental prohibitions or regulations, national emergencies, insurrections, riots or war, acts of terrorism, labor conditions, and epidemics/pandemics, that cannot be mitigated through the exercise of due care.
  (c) Amendment and Modification; Waiver. No amendment to or modification of this Agreement is effective unless it is in writing and signed by an authorized representative of each Party. No waiver by any Party of any of the provisions hereof will be effective unless explicitly set forth in writing and signed by the Party so waiving. Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, (i) no failure to exercise, or delay in exercising, any rights, remedy, power, or privilege arising from this Agreement will operate or be construed as a waiver thereof and (ii) no single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power, or privilege hereunder will preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power, or privilege.
  (d) Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability will not affect any other term or provision of this Agreement or invalidate or render unenforceable
      such term or provision in any other jurisdiction. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the Parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.
  (e) Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction. This Agreement is governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the District of Columbia without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule that would require or permit the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than those of the District of Columbia. Any legal suit, action, or proceeding arising out of or related to this Agreement or the licenses granted hereunder must be instituted exclusively in the federal courts of the United States or the courts of the District of Columbia, and each Party irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts in any such suit, action, or proceeding.
  (f) Assignment. You may not assign or transfer any of your rights or delegate any of your obligations hereunder, in each case whether voluntarily, involuntarily, by operation of law or otherwise, without the prior written consent of Entrupy. Any purported assignment, transfer, or delegation in violation of this Section is null and void. No assignment, transfer, or delegation will relieve the assigning or delegating Party of any of its obligations hereunder. This Agreement is binding upon and inures to the benefit of the Parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns.
  (g) Affiliations. This Agreement does not create a joint venture, partnership, principal-agent or employment relationship between you and Entrupy. Neither Party will have, or represent to a third-party that it has, the authority to act for or bind the other Party.
  (h) Feedback. You hereby grant Entrupy an unrestricted, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, worldwide right and license to use all feedback, suggestions, improvements, and recommendations you provide regarding the Software, and you acknowledge that Entrupy may use such feedback in its sole discretion without any notice or other obligation to you.

You shall comply with all applicable federal laws, regulations, and rules, and complete all required undertakings (including obtaining any necessary export license or other governmental approval), prior to exporting, re-exporting, releasing, or otherwise making the Software available outside the US.
  (j) Equitable Relief. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that a breach or threatened breach by such Party of any of its obligations under this Agreement would cause the
      other Party irreparable harm for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy and agrees that, in the event of such breach or threatened breach, the other Party will be entitled to equitable relief, including a restraining order, an injunction, specific performance, and any other relief that may be available from any court, without any requirement to post a bond or other security, or to prove actual damages or that monetary damages are not an adequate remedy. Such remedies are not exclusive and are in addition to all other remedies that may be available at law, in equity, or otherwise.
